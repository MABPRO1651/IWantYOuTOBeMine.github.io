      <h1>Hi,Iâ€™ve had a crush on you since the first day of school when we met. Iâ€™m not sure if you have a boyfriend or not, but I just want tell you how I feel. For some reason, I get really shy whenever Iâ€™m around you. I canâ€™t even look at your face without feeling nervous. I feel so nervous about talking to you, and I donâ€™t even know how to start a conversation.</h1>
